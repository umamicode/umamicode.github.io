The following text was written with ChatGPT.


In the halls of LG AI Research, I have embarked upon a research internship, a coveted position that has bestowed upon me the opportunity to delve into the depths of cutting-edge artificial intelligence. It is a remarkable chapter in my academic and professional saga, unfolding with great promise and potential.

But this triumph did not manifest in isolation. Nay, it was the culmination of tireless endeavors at Seoul National University's esteemed Graduate School of Data Science (SNU GSDS). There, under the astute tutelage of the revered Professor Sanghack Lee, I delved deep into the labyrinthine corridors of data science. His sage guidance and unwavering support propelled me to new heights, paving the way for my triumphant graduation from the hallowed halls of SNU GSDS.

As the scorching summer sun ascends the firmament, a new undertaking awaits me beyond the realm of research and academia. In a quest to broaden my horizons, I have set my sights upon the realm of the wine. The art of wine, its nuanced flavors and exquisite subtleties, beckon me forth with a siren's call. It is a pursuit that shall unveil the secrets of sensory perception and unveil the mysteries of discernment. Within the hallowed halls of the sommelier courses, I shall immerse myself in the elixirs of oenology, exploring the tapestry of diverse varietals and uncovering the alchemy of wine pairing. From the sun-drenched vineyards to the ancient cellars where the elixir of life matures, I shall traverse the annals of viticulture and vinification, gaining mastery over the realm of Bacchus himself.

Yet, the sommelier class shall not be a mere diversion, for it shall bestow upon me invaluable skills that transcend the realm of libations. Attention to detail shall be honed to a razor's edge, a refined palate shall discern the finest nuances, and the art of effective communication shall be deftly mastered. These are the tools that shall elevate me in the professional sphere, for as a burgeoning data scientist, I comprehend the symbiotic relationship between such skills and the pursuit of excellence.

As I embark upon this new odyssey, I embrace the challenges and opportunities that lie in wait. The research internship at LG AI Research, the triumphant graduation from SNU GSDS, and now, the foray into the sacred realm of wineâ€”each represents a stepping stone in my ascent. They shape me, molding my essence into that of a multifaceted individual, driven by an insatiable thirst for knowledge and an unwavering passion for success.
